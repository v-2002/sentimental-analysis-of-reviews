I am writing this after 2 months of use. I have switched to mi 10T after long use of moto G5 plus. I have bought this 6gb ram and 128gb merory variant in exchange offer at 24799 rs. MRP was 32999 and exchange price which I got was exceptionally unbelievable of about 7200rs and 1000 off with credit card.The pros and cons which I felt in last 2 months are as following:1. As an user of stock android, switching over MIUI OS was horrible experience. I m still feel unfort due to minor gliches , bugs which occur frequently. I love stock android over MIUI interface. If you love stock android, dont switch to MIUI platform otherwise you will regret. Sometimes mic doesnt work with whatsapp calling, sometimes unnecessary system notification will bother you which u will never be able to stop, sometime video get stuck while playing.2. Front camera quality is below par than my old phone. I m unsatisfied with front camera quality. Rear camera is just superb.3. Poor calling speaker nd mic quality. If u were a user of moto u'll definitely feel poor quality of voice over the call. Normal free hand speaker quality is above par. But this again create a issue. When you talk freehand, it create a loop of echo coz speaker voice get in loop with mic. That was not the problem with my older phone. Means you will have definitely not the option of handsfree talking.Speaker is lous for playing music. But it create much vibration on the backside of phone. Its definitely not a good while u r attending class or meetings.4. Processing and performace is superb. Its like a flagship variant. So far as a moderate user of phone, I'll give 10/10 in this segment.5. Battery is draining too fast if you use 144hz setting or even 90hz. Thatswhy i set it on 60hz. Though i m not a gamer. I use to watch videos and calling, chats. A full charged phone drains in around 18-20 hrs for moderate use. Based on my previous phone exoerience i expecting a battery life of 24-28 hrs in same kind of use. So I will give just 8/10 for this.In summary, Quality of video is superb, Sound for music is good, performance is flagship typ, calling hardware(mic n speaker) and front camera is of poor quality. MIUI OS is still having bugs, glitches , still i love stock android which is neat n clear for the best user satisfaction. Overall for user satifaction I will give 7/10.One more thing exchange experience with Amazon was fantastic. Earlier for the same product I had ordered on Flpkrt, they were alsk giving 7700 rs for exchange. But their courier represntative was seeing for even minor dot scratch on old phone. For a small needle tip dent he was deducting 2000rs. So i returned flipkrt guy. Ordered it on abazon nd received this very happily.

With exchange of my old phone got an awesome deal at low price. Overall happy with the phone and performance till now. Thank you Amazon and Xiaomi.I am using this phone from 40+ days and below are my personal opinions/experience that I see with my Mi 10t phone:Advantages I noticed:> Full charging time is around 1 hour 20 minutes with the provided charger.> For general use (like taking calls. listing to music) the phone is running/battery charge is lasting two days. If watching movies for very long hours the phone battery is lasting for  1 & 1/2 day.> This phone has good high level of vibration while receiving calls and SMS/notifications.> Front and back camera are good.> Dual speakers are good but can be better.> Premium build quality.> Wifi speed is good. Also 4G internet speed is good.> Calls audio level is good.Issues/Disadvantages I noticed:> MX player is not working. Have to use alternative like VLC or KMP players.> Even after setting different ringtone for secondary sim calls still primary sim ringtone will only ring.> Notification LED is not turning on while charging. Also after enabling notification led in notifications also it is not working for some of the apps when notifications are received.> Google dialer and messenger/SMS apps are not good.> Due to android version restrictions call recording audio level is very low in all the third party call recording software.> Google messenger/SMS app don't have dedicated/default sim selection option for sending SMS's. By default secondary sim is getting selected for first type sending SMS to any new phone/contact number.*Not played any games and also not much used refresh rate option.NOTE: All the above are my personal opinions/experience which I noticed with my Mi 10t phone. I am not sure if the same are with other Mi 10t phones.

I was actually hoping to get a flagship but ended up buying MI 10T due to budget issue.Firstly I am very much happy with my pick. This phone is just amazing for price to performance aspect. I'll keep it simple.Performance - 5/5 - its a super snappy.. smooth performance thanks to SD865. I can play Pubg at Smooth and 90fps or UHD and Extreme without a sweat. But absolutely loved playing COD in this as u can play at max frame rate at max graphics üòçScreen - 4/5 Best in class LCD, and my god 144hz refresh is buttery smooth. Content viewing is great... Personally i dont mind an LCD if its at this quality.Battery and charging - 4/5easliy gets u a days usage with 144hz, but if decreased u can go to 1.5 days. (All this with heavy usage like games and content viewing. Nitpicking - 33wats is great but its better if had a 65wt since its a 5000 mah batteryüòÖErgonomics - 4/5 - it may not be a slim and sleek and stylish looking mobile. But it got a sloid build with gorilla glass and metal frame.I saw reviewers complain about weight. But honestly, coming from a slim and sleek mobile which weighs 175gms i didnt feel much of a difference.Cameras - 3/5 - Personally i dont use camera very often so im ok i would give 4/5, but yeah it lags bit in cameras when compared to flagships.Verdict - Just go for it if your budget is around 30k. I say its better option than 10T pro as it packs all those features, apart from one main camera.

Been using this for 1 year. Not a single problem on the performance.Battery health is reduced to some extent.Gaming is perfect when using fan. Heats up  fast so there is  need of fan. Played bgmi in extreme smooth it is super. Not played 90 fps coz it drains battery fastThe only problem i got is the internet connectivity . Everytime I had to turn off/ on flight mode to get good internet. Really pisses me off when it comes to internet connection.cant give stable connection. Camera is super. Not a problem after 1 year.

This my 1st mobile  of MI, reallybad experience with MI ui .I will start with cons1 MI ui Android 11 update please guys the update is totally messed up who will say it's Snapdragon 865 .lots of bugs and even some time drop down box is getting stuck some time I have to restart.2camera quality is gimic though the shutter speed is high but it taking same quality like realme xt, Mi Honor play of 2018 take better photo than this. They have given some pro camera features but normal users don't require them.3 Battery life is not so good hardly giving 14 -16 hours battery backup in regular usage . I don't play games so never need to test my device in that field4. I bought this set for SD 865,DDR 5 Ram,UFS  3.1  means totaly I expect speed from this set but I just compare with approx 2.5 year old HONOR Play which has OTG usb 2.0 but it support 40MB/s speed to transfer data to SSDWhere as this device can transfer max upto 35MB/s data transfer speed to SSD so disappointed in that areaProsI will not blame every thing to this setThis set Support portable HDD upto 5TB which I have with media .my Honor play also Support upto 4tb HDD which I also haveWhere as One plus Nord doesn't support any of this .2 It has support of career aggregation so it going to 4G+speed where download speed is good3 the screen movement is really smooth.
